# chat-app

This App is still being worked on, It's a project as part of an online course.
I am still very new to Javascript and Firebase but It's very fun and enjoyable.

## Built With

* [Firebase / Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) - The Database used
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
* [ParticlesJS](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) - The background particles
